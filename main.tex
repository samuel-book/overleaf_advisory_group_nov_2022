\frametitle{Breaking down the emergency stroke pathway into key steps}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./images/pathway}
\end{center}
We can model key changes to pathway:
\begin{small}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What if the pathway were faster?
    \item What if hospital determined the stroke onset time in more patients?
    \item What if clinical decision-making was like that of \emph{benchmark} hospitals? (Predict what treatment a patient would receive at other hospitals).
\end{itemize}
\end{small}
\footnotesize{We model these changes with a hospital's own patient population, to allow for inter-hospital variation in patient population characteristics.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{SAMueL-1 Summary: What did we test?}

We used clinical pathway simulation and machine learning to analyse a series of \emph{what if?} questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{3mm}
    \item What if arrival-to-treatment time was 30 minutes?
    \item what if all hospitals determined stroke onset time as frequently as an \emph{upper quartile} hospital (a hospital ranked 25 out of 100, for determining stroke onset time).
    \item What if decisions to thrombolyse were made according to a majority vote of 30 benchmark hospitals?
\end{itemize}

For each hospital we use their own patients to ask these questions, to allow for differences in local patient populations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Machine learning overview}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.90\textwidth]{./images/ml_model_high_level}
\end{center}


Machine learning (and nearly all \emph{artificial intelligence}) is based on the simple principle of recognising similarity to what has been seen before.
\vspace{3mm}

We accessed 240,000 emergency stroke admissions in England and Wales over three years.

\begin{frame}{Model accuracy, and simplification}

Our machine learning models use XGBoost classification, and are based on all patients who arrive within 4 hours of known stroke onset.

\begin{columns}[T] % [T] Top aligns columns

        The full model has 61 patient features:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Overall accuracy = 85.2\%
            \item Best combined sensitivity and specificity = 84.3\%

        \end{itemize}
        \end{footnotesize}
    \end{column}
    
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
    The 8 features of the simplified model are:
        \begin{footnotesize}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Arrival-to-scan time
            \item Stroke type (infarction/haemorrhage)
            \item Stroke severity (NIHSS)
            \item Precise or estimated stroke onset time
            \item Prior disability level (mRS)
            \item Stroke team
            \item Use of AF anticoagulants
            \item Onset-to-arrival time
        \end{enumerate}
        \end{footnotesize}

\frametitle{Explaining model predictions with SHAP values}

SHAP values show the influence of features (even for \emph{`black box'} models).

Note: The effect of team ID can depend on other patient characteristics.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What drives use of thrombolysis across all hospitals?}

\footnotesize{Note: SHAP values here are \emph{log odds}. Each step-change in value of \textpm 1 changes the chances of receiving thrombolysis about 3-fold. (Plots are in order of feature importance.)}

\begin{frame}{Comparing hospital SHAP value with the predicted thrombolysis rate if all hospitals say the same 10k patients}

\footnotesize

\begin{itemize}
    \item We can assess each hospital’s ‘propensity to use thrombolysis’ by passing the same 10k cohort of patients through all hospital prediction models.
    \item We can compare this 10k thrombolysis rate to the average hospital SHAP.
    \item These two different methods of isolating the effect of the hopsital on thrombolysis use give very similar results.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{SHAP for all patients at each hospital}
    
Though each hospital has an average SHAP effect, the effect of the hospital varies with patients, depending on the hospital's own patterns of who they are more/less likely to give thrombolysis to.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Machine Learning key findings}
General observations about thrombolysis use: The chance of receiving thrombolysis is increased by:
\emph{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shorter arrival-to-scan times
    \item Mid-level stroke severity
    \item Precise onset time
    \item Lower pre-stroke disability
\end{itemize}
}

\vspace{5mm}

Lower thrombolysing units are particularly less likely to give thrombolysis to patients with:
\emph{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Low or high stroke severity
    \item Higher pre-stroke disability
    \item Estimated onset time
\end{itemize}
}

    \item Knowledge of hospital will allow linkage to SSNAP organisational audit data
    \item We had informal input from HQIP, and agreement that our data request can be considered as anonymised data, but there remains a small risk that HQIP will not consider data sufficiently anonymised.
